## GitHub flow
If you're unfamiliar with the GitHub flow, [this](https://guides.github.com/introduction/flow/) is a good, 5 minute long introduction. We're using the **Fork & Pull** model.

**Pull requests** should be immediately created. It's a good idea to set them to [draft mode](https://help.github.com/en/github/collaborating-with-issues-and-pull-requests/about-pull-requests#draft-pull-requests "draft mode") since they'll be around for some time. Undo this once others should review and accept the PR.
PRs are also the place to specify and discuss feature development. You can use GitHub flavored markdown ([GFM](https://guides.github.com/pdfs/markdown-cheatsheet-online.pdf)), including @&shy;mentions.

## Discussion
Discussing features should be done in the PR, if one exists.  
We have a [discussion channel](https://discord.gg/rMK6DFT) on the Wintergatan Discord guild.  
For more of a structured discussion, use GitHub [Issues](https://github.com/wintergatan-community/virtual-mmx/issues).
